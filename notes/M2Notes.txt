===========================

Configurations:

x86 (debug) - PVD is enabled
x86 (release) - PVD is disabled

NOTE:

Our prototype features a drivable surface, a cart and pickups.
Once the pickup (yellow sphere) is collected, a new one will spawn.


Our OpenGl rendering is very basic at this moment, but the PVD scene can show a shaded scene for clarity.


============================

In case the DLLs are missing from TopShopper/bin/Win32/debug or TopShopper/bin/Win32/release,
they can be found in x86DebugDLLs and x86ReleaseDLLs respectively.

============================

There is a chance that the cart will fall through the floor if that happens just reload the
game.
